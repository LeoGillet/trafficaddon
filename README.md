# trafficaddon
[FiveM] Edit your traffic spawnpool!
Download [here](https://github.com/LeoGillet/trafficaddon/releases/)

## Requirements
* A legit copy of GTA V
* File access to your FiveM server
* [OpenIV](https://openiv.com)
* Custom vehicles copied to your server resources folder

## Notes
I didn't include a popgroups.ymt file in this repository due to legal reasons.
You should extract it from your own copy of GTA V, this is explained below.

## Installation
1. Clone repository in your server's resources folder *or* download and extract into a created directory named **trafficaddon** in your resources folder
2. Make sure your file structure looks like this : *server/resources/trafficaddon/__resource.lua*
3. Copy your edited GTA V's **popgroups.ymt** file in the same directory **(Guide below)**
4. Make sure to add **start trafficaddon** to your server.cfg file (aswell as your vehicles)
5. Enjoy!

## Extract & Edit your popgroups.ymt file
1. Download and install [OpenIV](https://openiv.com)
2. Point your OpenIV to your GTA V installation
3. Navigate to *GTA V\update\update.rpf\x64\levels\gta5*
4. Right-click on popgroups.ymt and export to XML to remove encryption
5. Edit your exported popgroups.ymt.xml file to your liking and save it as popgroups.ymt again
